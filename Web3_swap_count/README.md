# BSC Transaction Analyzer

This Python script analyzes all transactions from a specific wallet address on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for a given date. It classifies the transactions into **successful** and **failed**, and exports the result into a CSV file.

Now supports `.env` configuration for cleaner code and easier reuse.
